# Globus Data Portal

This project is a React implementation Globus' JavaScript API which does simple file transfers between two endpoints. The primary contribution of this code is a library which packages the API in an easy to call manner and returns the JSONs that the queries return.

The source code for the project this is based on can be found [here](https://github.com/globus/static-data-portal). [This](https://github.com/globus/globus-sdk-javascript/blob/main/examples/basic/index.html) is also a useful example for anyone looking to understand the basic components of the Globus JS API.
